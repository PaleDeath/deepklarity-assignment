    "title": "Alan Turing",
    "summary": "Alan Turing was a British mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst who is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He played a pivotal role in breaking German ciphers during World War II at Bletchley Park, most notably the Enigma machine. His work laid the groundwork for modern computing, including the concept of the Turing machine.",
